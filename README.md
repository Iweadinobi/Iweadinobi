- 👋 Hi, I’m @Iweadinobi Adaeze, a not so new newbie to learning these things but then i'm so invested in learning whatever makes life easier and profits me just as much. I love to create as well, when i'm much better at these things.
- 👀 I’m interested in the metaverse and all things future tech, but then i have to begin from the basics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future projects once i better understand how to navigate github.
- 📫 You can reach me at iweadinobi22@gmail.com
